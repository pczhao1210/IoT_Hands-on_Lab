Welcome to session 1, please go to different folder to find the file you need.

This session aimed to create a full data path from IoT Device to IoT Dashboard, and pre-processing, routing and store these data to certain database.

In this example code, I use a PostgreSQL to store data, you may also try Azure SQL or MySQL in your own try, and the code in Azure Functions may also change.
